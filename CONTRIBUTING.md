# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AI-DLC. Whether it's a bug report, new rule, correction, or documentation improvement, we value feedback and contributions from the community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests.

## Tenets

Before contributing, familiarize yourself with our [tenets](README.md#tenets).

## Contributing Rules

AI-DLC rules live in `aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rule-details/`. When contributing:

- **Be reproducible**: Changes should be consistently reproducible either via test case or a series of step
- **Single source of truth**: Don't duplicate content. If guidance applies to multiple stages, put it in `common/` and reference it.
- **Keep it agnostic**: The core methodology shouldn't assume specific IDEs, agents, or models. Tool-specific files are generated from the source.

### Rule Structure

Rules are organized by phase:
- `common/` - Shared guidance across all phases
- `inception/` - Planning and architecture rules
- `construction/` - Design and implementation rules
- `operations/` - Deployment and monitoring rules

### Testing Changes

Test your rule changes with at least one supported platform (Amazon Q Developer, Kiro, or other tools) before submitting. Describe what you tested in your PR.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

Use GitHub issues to report bugs or suggest features. Before filing, check existing issues to avoid duplicates.

Include:
- Which rule or stage is affected
- Expected vs actual behavior
- The platform/model you tested with
